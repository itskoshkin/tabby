Tabby
======
Backup your Safari tab groups with Tabby.

Safari tab groups are an awesome way to manage your bookmarks. But, unfortunately at the moment, Safari does not provide a way to backup bookmarks stored within tab groups.

So let's fix that.

Tabby can:
- Export tab groups as HTML
- Export tab groups as CSV
- Export tab groups from default profile
- Export tab groups from all other profiles
- Export tab groups in current order (including tab order within groups)

**New:** _[Tabby is now available as a macOS app!](https://littletabby.app)_

## Installation

### 1. Install Go
Install Go 1.26 or newer:

https://go.dev/doc/install

### 2. Enable full disk permissions for Terminal app
1. Open System Settings.
2. Select Privacy & Security settings.
3. Select Full Disk Access.
4. Add Terminal app if not listed.
5. Enable Full Disk Access for Terminal app.

### 3. Install script
1. `git clone git@github.com:mokolabs/tabby.git ~/Desktop/tabby`
2. Open your terminal app.
3. Run `cd ~/Desktop/tabby` to open the tabby directory.
4. Run `go run .` to export your tab groups to the desktop.

You can also build a reusable binary:

```
go build -o tabby
./tabby
```

### 4. Optional steps
- Need to customize the export location? Add this flag: `--out file/path`
  ```
  go run . --out ~/Library/Backup
  ```
- Need to export a different `SafariTabs.db` file? Add this flag: `--db path/to/SafariTabs.db`
  ```
  go run . --db ~/Backups/SafariTabs.db
  ```
- Need to export tabs from the Safari Technology Preview app? Add this flag: `-stp`
  ```
  go run . -stp
  ```
- Need to move tabby to a different location? The script should work in any location within your home directory.
- Need to backup your tab groups on a daily basis? Just write a cron task that runs the tabby command!

## Development
